# Blue Screen of Death

## Conclusions and Epilogue

Interfaces aren’t inherently bad, on the contrary. It is part of our nature to try and interface with the world and our surroundings. Our ‘hardware’ is wired like that. The problem however, is with the software. Most software today is made by large companies: “Big Tech”. Their software, their interfaces, are optimized to make money. We as users are seduced to accept their interface at “(inter)face” value. While the interface promises to remove friction from our lives, it also brings us distance which ultimately disconnects us in many aspects of our lives. Especially from the perspective of an artist, the interface in its current state provides some fundamental implications for our practice. While the first generation of electronic media only broadcasted, it only directly affected our impression. But the current generation of electronic media is also directly interfering with our expression. Not only is expression important in daily life, for artists and designers it is also at the core of our work. It is therefore extra important for us to be aware of the interface, as our identity and work manifested in contemporary media are constrained by the arbitrary boundaries that are set by the corporations that develop the interfaces. As creatives we don’t want to lose ownership of our expression. We don’t want our expression to adhere to a company’s capitalist ideology and we don’t always want our work to be seen a commodity.

Throughout history, artists have been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of our media, reflecting on it, critiquing it, and uncovering its vast expressive possibilities. However, we now find ourselves facing the "Blue screen of death" (figure 8), confronting us with the fact that the system has failed. As we need to reclaim the interface, which key should we press to continue?
