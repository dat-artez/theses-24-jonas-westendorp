# Interface Value

## From Seduction to Uncritical Acceptance

> Unlike the personal computers that had come before, the “Mac” encouraged users to stay at a surface level of visual representation and gave no hint of inner mechanisms. The power of the Macintosh was how its attractive simulations and screen icons helped organize an unambiguous access to programs and data. The user was presented with a scintillating surface on which to float, skim, and play. [[7]](#cite-7)

The Macintosh, “the computer for the rest of us” as Apple called it,[[3]](#cite-3) aimed to make the personal computer available to people without knowledge of computers, making it simpler. In order to achieve this simplicity Apple opted to obscure the complicated part: the computer itself. Their way of doing this was to create a metaphorical reality within the computer, simulating a familiar office environment tailored to their primary audience. While it succeeded in making the computer simpler and thus making it accessible to a broader audience, it has created a situation where we developed an odd relationship with our electronics – a relationship where the connection between software and hardware is purely imaginary. While the purpose of the operating system is to interface between soft- and hardware, which are inherently interdependent, it resulted in an abstraction that separated the two to such an extent that they seem detached.
With the Macintosh, Apple planted the seed for a redefinition of the word “personal” in the personal computer. This definition has become very prevalent in the world we live in today. Originally, the term “personal” referred to the ownership of a computer and one's ability to operate it independently. Apple made an effort to humanize the computer, encouraging interaction with it as if it were a person. This has evolved to the point where nowadays, we carry a computer everywhere we go in the form of a mobile phone, making it so close to us that it has become an extension of ourselves. We share information with it that is so personal, we wouldn’t even share it with our friends.
On a hardware level, users weren’t even officially permitted to open the case of the Macintosh themselves, so if you wanted to upgrade or change the hardware you needed assistance of an Apple service center or an authorized third-party repair center (a policy that apple still partly uses to this date). Even though Jobs stated “customization is really in software now […]” [[8]](#cite-8), admitting that they didn’t want their customers to access the hardware themselves. But the software as well couldn’t really be called personal. While you could of course run many different pieces of software – potentially even written by yourself – on the Macintosh, you couldn’t change the software on a lower level: the operating system was not accessible for users to change. The Macintosh experience creates an environment that suggests that programming yourself is unnecessary (I will explore this point in more depth in the next chapter). With the graphical interface, Apple intentionally distanced the people from the hardware of the computer as a medium. As our dependency on their software, which remains inaccessible to us, has grown, we have lost the ownership of our devices. What is interesting about this, is that we don’t seem to care. Or, in the words of Turkle: “We have learned to take things at interface value.” [[9]](#cite-9)
