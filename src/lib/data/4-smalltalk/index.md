# No more SmallTalk

## How the Intellectual Origins of the GUI were Forgotten

> Unfortunately, when GUI became the commercially successful paradigm following the success of Apple’s Mac computers, introduced in 1984, the intellectual origins of GUI were forgotten. [[10]](#cite-10)

As I argued in previous chapters, with the Macintosh, Apple altered our perception of what a computer is for us as a medium. While before the Macintosh the personal computer was mainly used to compute things, nowadays the majority of people never use the computer to compute anything. With their GUI, Apple presented the Macintosh as a mediahub: a medium for simulating other media (more efficiently), turning the computer into a medium for consumption. However, as we can learn from media-theorist Lev Manovich in his book Software Takes command (2013), the function of the GUI doesn’t necessarily have to be defined by this. Manovich illustrates this by examining the Xerox Alto, which he identifies as “the intellectual origins of the GUI”, as it pioneered many of its fundamental concepts.
The Xerox Alto is a computer system that was developed in the 1970s at Xerox PARC, which was the R&D department of Xerox, a company that sells printers. The Xerox Alto is considered by many to be the first computer with a graphical operating system, allowing users to navigate graphically instead of typing commands. Unlike the Macintosh, the Xerox Alto did not reach a large audience. But as a research project it was a popular attraction amongst computer enthusiasts. It was a really impactful project as it envisioned the philosophy and many of the concepts of the GUI that directly inspired companies such as Apple and Microsoft (they all visited Xerox PARC). Many of the concepts that we see return in the Macintosh are navigation using a mouse, windows and icons (figure 5). [[11]](#cite-11)

What made the interface of the Xerox Alto so effective was that it offered a new mental model of the computer that was much easier for people to interact with. Previously, the Command Line Interface (CLI) made it intimidating for people to interact with a computer, as it was too abstract and had no resemblance to the real world. What they realized at PARC was that the mechanisms we use to understand the real world also needed to be available in the simulated world of the interface.
The approach they took to achieve this was based on the constructivist learning theory as interpreted by Alan Kay, one of the leading figures in the Alto project who remains active as a writer and blogger on the subject of computer interfaces and their influence. According to this theory, originally formulated by American psychologist Jerome Bruner, individuals engage with three "modes of representation” (Kay refers to this as “mentalities”) in learning and interaction. These he called Enactive representation (action-based), Iconic representation (image-based) and Symbolic representation (language-based) (figure 6). These three modes can be thought of as being in order of a child's age as it learns. But Bruner argues that as adults we still like to go through the same stages (mentalities) whenever we learn something new. [[12]](#cite-12)

First we experience fractions through direct actions, like slicing a pizza.
Secondly we learn to interact with fractions through internal representations, such as a schematic visualization.
And thirdly we learn to understand fractions through a language of mathematical symbols.

According to Manovich: “Kay’s interpretation of this theory was that a user interface should appeal to all these three mentalities. In contrast to a command-line interface, which is not accessible for children and forces the adult to use only symbolic mentality, the new interface should also make use of emotive and iconic mentalities.” [[12]](#cite-12) To actualize this “the group at PARC mapped Bruner’s theory of multiple mentalities into the interface technologies in the following way. Mouse activates enactive mentality (know where you are, manipulate). Icons and windows activate iconic mentality (recognize, compare, configure.) Finally, Smalltalk programming language allows for the use of symbolic mentality (tie together long chains of reasoning, abstract.)” [[12]](#cite-12)
That was what made the GUI of the Xerox Alto so appealing to Apple: it allowed people to "think different". However, one fundamental part in particular was “forgotten”: the perception of the computer as a "metamedium".
The concept metamedium was first introduced by Alan Kay. This concept is a result of his research and development on interfaces for the computer. Kay believed that the most important property of the medium of the computer was its ability to both consume/simulate and create other media. It can be a tool to create other tools.
The goal was not just to have people learn to use a medium, but for them to truly master it. This is what Kay calls being "literate" in a medium. To achieve this, the researchers at PARC tried to identify what was necessary to understand in order to truly master a medium. Kay articulates this concept as follows: “The ability to ‘read’ a medium means you can access materials and tools generated by others. The ability to write in a medium means you can generate materials and tools for others. You must have both to be literate.” [[13]](#cite-13) What this meant was that they wanted people to be able to both read and write computer code. To facilitate this, they equipped their operating system with their own programming language named SmallTalk. The entire GUI and all the applications that came with it were written in SmallTalk, making the interfaces consistent among all applications and making all the code accessible to users so they could serve as examples. Not only did this encourage people to tinker around in the code and learn how to write their own programs, it also proved that programming could be learned by a wide range of people. Some examples of this, as shown in a video lecture by Kay titled “Doing with Images Makes Symbols” (1987), include: a drawing program resembling a primitive version of MacPaint created by a twelve-year-old, a diagram program for electrical circuits developed by a fifteen-year-old, and an animation program developed by an adult, all of whom had never programmed anything before learning Smalltalk.
The Macintosh did not support SmallTalk, nor did it provide users with access to the operating system's code. Like the hardware, the software was a very closed-off system. By branding the Macintosh as “the computer for the rest of us,” Apple deliberately distanced the user from the programmer. Through their marketing, Apple communicated that programming was too complex for ordinary people to understand and not worth the time to learn. According to Kay's definition of literacy, this would mean that the Macintosh is a read-only medium—a platform primarily for consumption. By discouraging users from writing to their medium, Apple effectively denied them the mastery of it and the ability to use the computer's full creative potential.
