# Inter‧face: my interpretation

Interfaces are about what happens in between our faces. They are about how we use our faces in communication. In this context I like to interpret the word “face” as a symbol for all the different ways that we can communicate: a tool we can use to communicate our expression and manifest our thoughts. The goal of this manifestation is usually to make your thoughts perceivable (for others or just for yourself). In order to manifest our thoughts, we have to project them onto a medium. We can interpret the word medium here literally as “in the middle”. It is in the middle of the two ends of a communication channel. It encapsulates everything that happens to send information from one “face” to another. It is the system through which information moves. Face-to-face conversation is the primal example of this. Whenever one of the participants has something to say, they can manifest their thought using the medium speech. In the modern world the media we use have become much more complex. What consequences does that have for us and what is the role of the interface in this?
Take for instance the medium Whatsapp. It can be the connection between two persons – let’s call them Sender and Receiver – who want to share a text message. Whatsapp is a medium because it handles everything in between Sender and Receiver, from registering the inputs on Sender’s mobile phone to displaying a text message on the phone of Receiver. The interface is what Sender and Receiver see at the edge of this medium: a collection of visual indicators – such as windows, icons and buttons – that register and display the interaction.

The devices that we use for our communication are not just technical parts of a medium, they are (active) participants in it and they therefore also change how we experience communication. So when examining the interface, we therefore also have to acknowledge the “face” of our devices. We can therefore interpret the word inter-face as the place in between the faces. It is the place where we transfer a thought from our “face” onto the “face” of a medium. It can be seen as the translation layer of a medium, an interpreter from a human language to a device's language.
