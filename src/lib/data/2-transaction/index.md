# From Interaction to Transaction

## Big Tech Takes Control

With the Macintosh, Apple made a computer system that valued software over hardware. Its selling point was the interface between the hard- and software that they created: their operating system. The emphasis on software was explicitly communicated by Apple through many of their marketing channels. We can see that none of the hardware specifications were mentioned, which was very different from their competitors. IBM for example included a detailed table with all of the specifications.

40 years after its release, the world has been taken over by "Big Tech" companies that develop software, and interfaces are their defining value. We are living in an economy where companies can thrive solely by developing interfaces as products, without generating new material value. We are living in an Interface Economy.
But what exactly makes the interface so valuable? To get a better understanding of this, I took a closer look at Apple’s “premiere” presentation of the Macintosh, where Steve Jobs presented the Macintosh and their vision for its new interface paradigm for the first time to the general public. Here we see how Jobs, together with the developers, demonstrate a few programs that were specifically created for the Macintosh and that take full advantage of the new GUI paradigm. First, we see MacPaint, a drawing program which is basically an early version of a program like Photoshop that we use today. MacPaint has a virtual canvas on which you can draw with virtual drawing tools such as a pencil, a paintbrush and a spray can (figure 4). They showed how you can use the computer to create paintings in a way that is inspired by how we would create them in the physical world. And of course, it showed how the computer can greatly enhance some of these processes, with functions such as the “paintbucket” that can instantly fill entire surfaces, how you can create multiple copies of a (piece of a) painting and how you can easily undo an action if you made a mistake. All with just a simple mouse click.

The two programs that follow afterwards, MacWrite and a chess game, tell a similar story: the computer can do all the things you are already doing and it can do it faster, better and simpler. What it showed is that the Macintosh could simulate other media and that they could make our media drastically more efficient by “wrapping” it in an interface.
As Ed Finn, Associate Professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society at Arizona State University, notes in his book What Algorithms Want (2017), many companies picked up on this, as they “literally present themselves as ‘wrappers’ around existing services, bundling, organizing, and demystifying them for a painless user experience.” [[5]](#cite-5) This notion meant that the principles of the interface economy could be applied to many different domains. Finn describes these principles as follows:

> [T]raditional social and commercial interactions are increasingly conducted through apps and screens that depend on sophisticated, tightly designed forms of abstraction and simplification. […] Their [interface companies] rhetoric relies on the notion of technological collaboration and just-in-time delivery: taking advantage of unused resources like empty seats in cars, unused rooms in houses, and so forth. But all of these interactions are grounded in the mediating computational layer that manages ad hoc logistics, matches buyers and sellers of services, and structures access to platforms through carefully constructed interfaces. [[6]](#cite-6)

But as the interface allows for smoother interactions from the user’s perspective, it is ultimately designed to let this interaction end in a transaction. A transaction with the goal of creating economic value for the creator of the interface. There are countless examples of interfaces that have disrupted entire industries. Take a company like Uber, which employs millions of drivers and competes with taxis all over the world, without the need for even owning a single car. All the company needs to do is connect two parties – in this case a passenger and a driver – and make everything up to the transaction a frictionless experience. As a result of this, we encounter more and more interfaces in our lives that inherit this transactional structure, which can become undesirable when the interface extends into other aspects of our lives that are not – or should not be – a transaction.
