## “We are Forever Elsewhere” [[18]](#cite-18)

As Joshua Meyrowitz argues in his book No Sense of Place (1985), all new (mass) media have once “changed the patterns of information flow to and from places”. [[19]](#cite-19) He does however observe that electronic media had a particular strong effect on our sense of place: “They [electronic media] lead to a nearly total dissociation of physical place and social ‘place.’ When we communicate through telephone, radio, television, or computer, where we are physically no longer determines where and who we are socially.”[[18]](#cite-18) Once an interface has “translated” our inputs into an electrical signal it can travel all around the world almost instantaneously, making distance, or space, no longer a constraint of our communication.
My interpretation of this is that, after our exposure to electronic media, our identity is no longer strictly tied to a place. As Turkle puts it “[w]e are forever elsewhere” [[18]](#cite-18) fragmenting our identity: “your identity on the computer is the sum of your distributed presence”.[[20]](#cite-20) A fragmented presence however is not greater than the sum of its parts. Whenever we feel bored for just a minute, an interface can instantly move us to a different, virtual place. This fundamentally splits our presence across places, neither of these presences being complete. A split that is similar to the one that occurred in the Macintosh, where the interface has distanced the software on a computer from its hardware. This metaphor can also be applied to ourselves: our physical presence lacks the “software” of our attention or mental presence, while our virtual presence is missing the “hardware” of our body and physicality. Just as software cannot run without hardware, our mind cannot exist without our body.
As “software is a functional analog of ideology”,[[21]](#cite-21) the interface economy reinforces the culture-nature dichotomy inherent in the ideology of capitalism. As media theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, concludes at the end of her essay “On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge” (2005): “Software has become a commonsense shorthand for culture and hardware a shorthand for nature.” [[22]](#cite-22) Software is a control mechanism and hardware is there to be exploited as an ideology machine. Nature is becoming a mere backdrop for our cultural constructions. And while the interface is fundamentally disconnecting, it (social media in particular) is often ironically claiming that it does the opposite.

> “Facebook’s mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” [[23]](#cite-23)

Big tech is exploiting our desire for connection, belonging and community, while in reality it has been proven that we feel lonelier than ever. [[24]](#cite-24)
