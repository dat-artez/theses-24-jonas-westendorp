# The Faceless

## Victims of the Interface Economy

In this chapter, I will argue that the "Two kinds of people” the interface economy actually has created are those who can use interfaces, and those who cannot.
Digital literacy is becoming an important skill in the age of the interface economy. This economy gives us interfaces for everything, promising that it will make our lives more efficient and friction free. This economy developed the notion that almost any two things can be interfaced as long as you can get the ‘faces’ to speak the same language or protocol. This can however create a problem for those who cannot quickly learn a new “language” each time they are introduced to a new interface. Especially when the interfaced interactions replace the old ones to a large extent. Those who are not able to use the interface get excluded from these parts of society. Since a large part of this thesis is about the interface economy, let’s take the interfacing of money as an example. It is our medium of exchange that is becoming increasingly more interfaced and its traditional physical form – cash – is disappearing. Our use of the medium money is pretty much essential for our survival, which makes it very problematic for those who cannot access it or adapt to its new interfaced form. Elderly people often have difficulty with this: paying with card, online payments, fraud.
Or for instance think of homeless people and street musicians, who are affected by this in twofold. On the one hand, they might struggle to even open a bank account which makes this medium inaccessible in the first place. On the other hand, they are also affected by the people around them who have made the transition to digital money and don’t carry cash with them anymore. A street musician that was interviewed by the Dutch newspaper NRC said that his income has halved after most people transitioned to cashless payment. [[17]](#cite-17) The interface eliminated inefficiencies such as spare change.
Those who have no face cannot be interfaced. However, just as most of us no longer see the faces of our royals and leaders on bills and coins, a medium can also become faceless as a result of the digital interface, rendering it more abstract and obscuring those in power (figure 7).
