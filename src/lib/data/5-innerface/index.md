# The Inner-Face

## The Interface's Interference with Our Perception

We have lost SmallTalk on our computers, but are we perhaps also losing “small talk” in our physical reality? As we can learn from American psychologist Sherry Turkle’s book Reclaming Conversation (2015), face-to-face communication is important for us to develop relationships, creativity and empathy. Interfaces interfere with this. Looking at the definition of an interface we place an additional layer “in between” our “faces”. As we can learn from Turkle’s book, a lot of important things are happening in this in-between space. Hearing your own words coming from your mouth, seeing the other person’s (facial) response. Paying attention to the other person, but also to yourself. Their response is also part of your responsibility.
As we increasingly rely on interfaces to manage our communication, we run the risk of losing essential social skills. Or, to again use the words of Edd Finn: the “constrained intimacy” provided by the interface, can act as a shield for our empathy. “Increasingly we outsource the determination of bias, of commercial viability, indeed of context itself, to the algorithm, asking the interface layer to do not just the logistical but the ethical and cultural work for us.” [[14]](#cite-14)
But an interface can also house itself in our own bodies instead of a machine. We have our own interface inside our minds, that is in between us and the world around us which is trying to make sense of everything. Our senses are the interfaces of our perception. Let's call this the “inner-face”.
This inner-face is at the core of every face-to-face conversation. It tries to make sense of the other person's expression, translating sounds into words, facial expressions into emotions. To truly understand someone is an exercise in mirroring someone’s inner-face. This however becomes much more difficult when an interface dictates the structure of an interaction. In the interface economy this means that our interaction is a transaction, a consumption, which our relationships with people shouldn’t be. In an interface economy our interactions are supposed to be frictionless. But removing the friction also means removing the opportunity to overcome misunderstandings and develop a deeper understanding of one another, to respect one’s unique views, and develop consensus about the rules of your unique conversation.
Offloading this responsibility to the interface means we are giving away the “ownership” of our relationships. The interface is becoming our connection with other people, whereas in the past this was something you had to actively seek yourself. As we can learn from Turkle’s book, interfaced interactions are impacting our relationships across all our social circles. Interfaces create social distance between the ones who are close to us (inside our bubble) but especially between the ones who were already distant (outside our bubble). This deteriorating connection between bubbles lowers social cohesion, [[15]](#cite-15) further increasing the polarization of society.
