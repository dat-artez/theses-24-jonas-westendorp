> In the olden days before 1984, not very many people used computers.

> For a very good reason.

> Not very many people knew how. And not very many people wanted to learn.

> After all, in those days, it meant listening to your stomach growl through computer seminars. Falling asleep over computer manuals. And staying awake nights to memorize commands so complicated you'd have to be a computer to understand them.

> Then, on a particularly bright day in Cupertino, California, some particularly bright engineers had a particularly bright idea: since computers are so smart, wouldn't it make more sense to teach computers about people, instead of teaching people about computers?

> […]

> [B]oth [software and hardware engineers] were united by a common goal: to build the most powerful, most portable, most flexible, most versatile computer not-very-much-money could buy.[[3]](#cite-3)

In the year 1984 Apple introduced the world to Macintosh: a personal computer that was housed in a beige box that had a built-in black and white screen. It could read programs off a floppy disk and it could be operated using a (one button) mouse and a keyboard. The Macintosh is considered by many as the first personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI) that had a great commercial success. (In the chapter “No more SmallTalk” I will describe how it was in fact preceded by the Xerox Alto, which was commercially much smaller.) The Macintosh greatly influenced how people use computers and it laid the foundations of the interfaces that we are using today (figure 2), making it the perfect subject for a case study.

You can clearly see that a lot of the elements of this GUI are still present and recognizable in our present-day systems.

The Macintosh really showed the importance of a good interface. With their GUI, Apple provided a simple translation layer for people to interact with a highly complex system, which was a great deal for people who found computers with a traditional command line interface too intimidating. The GUI made the computer accessible for a much wider range of people. Before the Macintosh, computers were big clunky calculation machines that were mostly used by computer nerds. Apple made the computer cool (figure 3). Apple changed our perspective of what a computer is.

The commercial success of the Macintosh interface was the first step towards the interface economy we live in today. An economy that has grown to a point where it seems that each day, more and more interactions in our lives are becoming interfaced, from our communication and navigation to self-checkout at the supermarket.
In this thesis I will compare some of the aspects of the Macintosh with the systems we are using today and I will look at the consequences of the many interfaces in our lives in more detail. Firstly, I will show how the interface is essentially a control mechanism. It can be used to (re)define the boundaries of a medium. It can change our perception of a medium and what it can do. And it can nudge our behavior on a medium towards consumption.
Secondly, I will show that the interface induces multiple levels of distancing, a somewhat paradoxical "side effect" often overlooked. On one hand, although the intention of the interface is to make the medium more user-friendly (bringing us closer), it actually distances us from the medium itself. On the other hand, contrary to the promise of social media to connect us, integrating an interface into our social interactions creates more social distance.
And lastly, I will show how the interface influences our expression and identity, how we are losing ownership of this, and how our identity becomes constrained by the artificial boundaries set by interfaces.
